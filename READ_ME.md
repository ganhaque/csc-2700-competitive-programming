OP = Optimization possible

| Number | Title | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
100 | The 3n + 1 problem | find maximum
10055 | Hashmat the Brave Warrior | trivial
10071 | Back to Highschool Physics | trivial
11172 | Relational Operator | trivial
272 | TEX Quotes | trivial, string-reading
11727 | Cost Cutting | OP
10038 | Jolly Jumpers | a lot of loops, hashmap-esque?, OP
10783 | Odd Sum | trivial
458 | The Decoder | ASCII-value, simple
10300 | Ecological Premium | weird/misleading output
102 | Ecological Bin Packing | annoying, OP
10035 | Primary Arithmetic | parsing_int, good
494 | Kindergarten Counting Game | sample input does not have weird cases, trivial if you know ASCII or use isalpha
10082 | WERTYU | brute-force is the only solution ??? skipping this :expressionless:
10189 | Minesweeper | idk how, vector? :expressionless:, parsing_string
11498 | Division of Nlogonia | trivial
